## 1. Perplexity Computer & Personal Computer

### Perplexity Computer (Cloud Agent) — Launched Feb 25, 2026

Perplexity Computer is a **multi-model AI agent system** that can execute complex workflows independently. It's not a browser agent — it's a full digital worker.

**Architecture:**
- **Core reasoning**: Claude Opus 4.6
- **Sub-agent orchestration**: Uses 19+ AI models, picking the best for each sub-task:
  - Gemini for deep research (creating sub-agents)
  - Nano Banana for image generation
  - Veo 3.1 for video
  - Grok for speed/lightweight tasks
  - ChatGPT 5.2 for long-context recall and wide search
- **Execution model**: Breaks goals into tasks → sub-tasks → spawns sub-agents → orchestrates completion
- **Duration**: Can run for hours or months on persistent workflows
- **Actions**: Web research, document generation, data processing, API calls, email, purchases

**Pricing**: $200/month (Perplexity Max tier)

### Perplexity Personal Computer (Local Agent) — Announced Mar 11, 2026

An **always-on local AI agent** running on a dedicated Mac mini:

- Merges Perplexity Computer's cloud capabilities with local file/app access
- Runs 24/7 on dedicated hardware
- Full access to local files, apps, and sessions
- Controllable from any device remotely
- Runs in a "secure environment"
- Currently **Mac-only**, waitlist access

**Key insight**: This is Perplexity's bet that AI agents need **persistent local presence** — not just cloud API calls, but always-on access to your actual computer.

### How site2cli Relates to Perplexity

| Dimension | Perplexity Computer | site2cli |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Target user | Consumers, enterprise | Developers, AI engineers |
| Interface | Chat/GUI | CLI/MCP/API |
| Approach | Black-box orchestration | Transparent, inspectable |
| Distribution | SaaS ($200/mo) | Open-source, self-hosted |
| Composability | Monolithic assistant | Unix-philosophy, pipeable |
| Website interaction | Via sub-agents (opaque) | Formalized into deterministic CLIs |
| Local access | Personal Computer (Mac mini) | Runs on any machine |

**Strategic takeaway**: Perplexity is going "consumer AI OS" — site2cli is going "developer power tool." These are complementary, not competitive. site2cli could even be a tool *inside* a system like Perplexity Computer.

## 2. The Agentic Browser Landscape (March 2026)

### Market Size
- AI browser market: **$4.5B (2024) → $76.8B by 2034** (32.8% CAGR)
- 10,000+ active MCP servers
- MCP donated to Linux Foundation (December 2025)

### Current Browser Agent Reliability

| Agent | Benchmark | Success Rate |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Browser Use | WebVoyager (586 tasks) | 89.1% |
| OpenAI CUA | WebVoyager | 87% |
| Skyvern 2.0 | Overall | 85.85% |
| Amazon Nova Act | ScreenSpot Web Text | 93.9% |
| General range | Various | 30-89% |

**Key finding**: Reliability has improved dramatically from ~15-35% (early 2025) to **85-89%** on benchmarks. But: "success rates range from 30% to 89% depending on the tool and task" — real-world is still much lower than benchmarks.

### Major New Entrant: Vercel agent-browser

**This is the closest thing to site2cli that now exists.**

- **What**: CLI-first browser automation for AI agents (Rust + Node.js)
- **How**: AI agents control browser via shell commands (`agent-browser snapshot`, `agent-browser click @e1`)
- **Key innovation**: Accessibility-tree snapshots with element references (@e1, @e2), not CSS selectors
- **Performance**: 93% less context usage than Playwright MCP; 5.7x more test cycles per context budget
- **Works with**: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Goose, OpenCode, Windsurf

**How it differs from site2cli:**
| | agent-browser | site2cli |
|---|---|---|
| Goal | Better browser automation | Eliminate browser automation |
| Approach | CLI commands for browser control | Auto-generate API clients from observed traffic |
| Output | Browser actions | OpenAPI specs, Python clients, MCP servers |
| Progressive formalization | No | Yes (Browser → Workflow → API) |
| End state | Still using a browser | Direct API calls, no browser needed |

**Insight**: agent-browser makes browser automation *better for agents*. site2cli makes browser automation *unnecessary* by graduating to direct API calls. They're solving different layers of the same problem.

### Consumer AI Browsers (New Category)

| Browser | Key Feature | Pricing |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Perplexity Comet | Multi-site research + transactions | Free / $200 Max |
| ChatGPT Atlas | Autonomous multi-step tasks | Free / $20 Plus |
| Dia (Browser Company → Atlassian) | AI-first, enterprise | Acquired Sept 2025 |
| Genspark | 169+ on-device models, MCP Store (700+ integrations) | $160M raised |
| Sigma AI Browser | Privacy-first, fully free agentic features | Free |
| Fellou | Transparent workflow inspection | Various |

### Infrastructure Players (Updated)

| Company | What | Latest |
|---------|------|--------|
| Browserbase | Cloud browsers for agents | Released Stagehand v3 (Feb 2026, 44% faster) |
| Steel | Self-hostable browser API | Open-source core |
| Composio | 150+ tool integrations | Added MCP support |
| Anon | Auth infrastructure for agents | Managed credentials |
| Lightpanda | Purpose-built headless browser in Zig | New entrant |

## 3. WebMCP: The Game-Changing Standard

### What It Is
**WebMCP** (Web Model Context Protocol) is a **W3C Community Group standard** jointly developed by Google and Microsoft. It's available in Chrome 146 Canary (Feb 2026).

### How It Works
Websites declare their capabilities as structured tools via the `navigator.modelContext` API:

**Two approaches:**
1. **Declarative API**: Standard actions defined in HTML forms — browser auto-exposes them as tools
2. **Imperative API**: Complex interactions requiring JavaScript — websites register tools programmatically

### Why This Matters for site2cli

**WebMCP is both a threat and an opportunity:**

**Threat**: If websites adopt WebMCP, they'll natively expose structured tools for agents. site2cli's "discover APIs from traffic" approach becomes less necessary for WebMCP-enabled sites.

**Opportunity**:
- WebMCP adoption will be slow (years for broad adoption)
- The long tail of websites will never implement it
- site2cli can **consume** WebMCP declarations as another discovery source
- site2cli can act as a **bridge** for sites that don't have WebMCP yet

**Performance**: WebMCP achieves **89% token efficiency improvement** over screenshot-based methods.

**Timeline**: Native browser support (Chrome + Edge) expected H2 2026. Other browsers TBD.

## 4. "CLI Is the New API" — The Emerging Thesis

A significant debate is happening in the developer community:

**Key argument** (Eugene Petrenko, Feb 2026): "A well-designed CLI is often the fastest path to making tools usable by AI agents." AI agents discovered and autonomously used the GitHub CLI without explicit instruction — they're "already fluent with command-line workflows."

**The pattern:**
1. Ship genuinely usable CLIs with stable commands
2. Document tool availability in `AGENTS.md`
3. Maintain stable output contracts (treat CLI output as API)
4. Improve tools through real agent usage

**"MCP is dead. Long live the CLI"** hit top of Hacker News (85 points, 66 comments). Thesis: MCP shines for interactive use, but for automated pipelines, CLI + direct API wins.

**Implication for site2cli**: This validates the CLI-first approach. site2cli should generate CLIs that are directly usable by AI agents *without MCP* — just shell commands. MCP is an additional output format, not the primary one.

---

## 5. OpenAPI → MCP Auto-Generation (Solved Problem)

Multiple tools now convert OpenAPI specs to MCP servers:

| Tool | Approach |
|------|----------|
| **FastMCP** (v2.0) | Python — auto-generates MCP from OpenAPI spec |
| **Stainless** | Commercial — generates MCP servers from OpenAPI |
| **openapi-mcp-generator** | Open-source converter |
| **AWS OpenAPI MCP Server** | Dynamic MCP tool creation from specs |
| **cnoe-io/openapi-mcp-codegen** | Code generator |

**Important caveat**: "LLMs achieve significantly better performance with well-designed and curated MCP servers than with auto-converted OpenAPI servers."

**Implication**: site2cli's pipeline (website → traffic → OpenAPI → MCP) is validated — the OpenAPI→MCP leg is solved. site2cli's value is in the **website → OpenAPI** leg.

---

## 6. Distribution Strategy Recommendations

Based on research into how comparable tools distribute:

### Immediate (Do Now)

1. **Register `site2cli` on PyPI** — name squatting risk is real
2. **`pip install site2cli` / `pipx install site2cli` / `uv tool install site2cli`**
3. **Add `site2cli setup` command** — installs Playwright browsers, validates keyring, creates dirs
4. **Make browser deps optional**: `pip install site2cli[browser]` for full suite, base package for Tier 3 only

### Recommended pyproject.toml changes:
```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
browser = ["playwright>=1.40.0", "browser-cookie3>=0.19.0"]
cookies = ["browser-cookie3>=0.19.0"]
all = ["site2cli[browser,cookies]"]
```

### Short-term (100+ users)
5. **Homebrew tap**: `brew tap lonexreb/site2cli && brew install site2cli`
6. **Docker image**: For CI and MCP server hosting
7. **MCP invocation via uvx**: `uvx site2cli mcp-serve` (how Claude Desktop expects it)

### Medium-term (1000+ users)
8. **Homebrew core** formula
9. **GitHub Actions release automation**
10. **Shell completion**: Typer's `--install-completion` + dynamic completions for discovered sites

### Not recommended (yet)
- Standalone binary (Playwright makes this impractical — 100-400MB browser binaries)
- Electron desktop app (CLI-first tool doesn't need it)
- npm package (Python tool, no benefit)

```

**site2cli's unique position**: The only tool that starts universal (any website via browser) and progressively moves toward structured (deterministic API calls). Everything else is either one or the other.

## 8. Key Strategic Insights

### What's changed since the original plan

1. **Browser agents got much better** (89% on benchmarks vs 15-35% a year ago) — but still not reliable enough for production
2. **WebMCP is coming** — Google/Microsoft W3C standard for websites to declare capabilities. Long-term threat, short-term irrelevant (adoption will take years)
3. **Vercel agent-browser exists** — CLI-first browser control, but doesn't do formalization
4. **"CLI is the new API" thesis gaining traction** — validates site2cli's approach
5. **OpenAPI → MCP is solved** — FastMCP, Stainless do this well. site2cli's value is website → OpenAPI
6. **Perplexity going consumer/enterprise** — leaves developer power-tool niche wide open
7. **MCP ecosystem is massive** (10,000+ servers, Linux Foundation) — but auto-generation from arbitrary websites is still unsolved

### site2cli's moat

1. **Progressive formalization** — nobody else does Browser → Workflow → API graduation
2. **Website → OpenAPI** pipeline — the unsolved link in the chain
3. **Developer-first, Unix-philosophy** — composable, inspectable, scriptable
4. **Community specs** — yt-dlp model of community-contributed website adapters

### Biggest risks (updated)

1. **WebMCP adoption** — if websites natively declare capabilities, reverse-engineering becomes less valuable
2. **Browser agent reliability** — if agents hit 99%+, formalization adds less value
3. **Vercel agent-browser** — well-funded, good branding, solves adjacent problem
4. **Legal landscape** — Amazon v. Perplexity lawsuit (Nov 2025) could set precedent

### Biggest opportunities

1. **Long tail of websites** — most will never implement WebMCP or ship MCP servers
2. **Enterprise compliance** — deterministic, auditable CLI calls vs black-box agents
3. **MCP distribution channel** — publish community-generated MCP servers
4. **WebMCP bridge** — site2cli can consume WebMCP + fallback to traffic capture

## 9. CLI-Anything Analysis (HKUDS)

**GitHub**: github.com/HKUDS/CLI-Anything — 11.7k stars, MIT license

### What It Does

CLI-Anything uses an LLM-driven 7-phase pipeline to analyze **source code** of desktop/professional software and auto-generate Click-based Python CLIs that AI agents can control. It targets local applications (GIMP, Blender, Audacity, LibreOffice, OBS, etc.) — 11 software integrations validated with 1,508 passing tests.

**Pipeline**: Analyze source code → Design command groups → Implement Click CLI → Plan tests → Write tests → Document → Publish (pip install to PATH).

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Dimension | CLI-Anything | site2cli |
|---|---|---|
| **Target** | Desktop software (source code) | Web applications (HTTP traffic) |
| **Discovery** | Static analysis of source | Dynamic traffic capture (CDP) |
| **Source code required?** | Yes (open-source) | No (black-box) |
| **Output format** | Click CLI + JSON | OpenAPI spec + Typer CLI + MCP server |
| **Progressive?** | No (generate once, refine manually) | Yes (auto-promotes Browser → Workflow → API) |
| **Auth handling** | App-specific (OAuth2 etc.) | Generic (browser cookies, keyring) |
| **Agent interface** | JSON stdout + plugin registration | MCP server (standard protocol) |
| **Test suite** | 1,508 tests | 156 tests |
| **Overlap** | None — different target domains | None — different target domains |

### Key Takeaway

**Complementary, not competing.** CLI-Anything wraps local desktop software by reading source code. site2cli wraps web applications by observing network traffic. A user wanting full AI-agent coverage could use both: CLI-Anything for desktop apps, site2cli for web services.

### What We Can Learn From CLI-Anything

1. **Test density**: 1,508 tests across 11 integrations (~137 tests/integration) sets a high bar for credibility
2. **Professional README**: Badges, comparison tables, architecture diagrams, demo GIFs — polished presentation matters for adoption
3. **Plugin ecosystem**: Claude Code / OpenCode / Codex integrations — meeting agents where they already are
4. **JSON-first output**: Structured output for agent consumption is table stakes

## 10. webctl Analysis

**GitHub**: github.com/cosinusalpha/webctl — 409 stars, MIT license, Python 3.11+

### What It Does

webctl is a daemon+CLI browser automation tool that runs a persistent browser backend (via Unix socket) and exposes page interaction commands (navigate, click, type, select, screenshot, query). It optimizes for reliable automation with features like cookie banner dismissal, retry logic, rich wait conditions, and accessibility tree extraction.

**Architecture**: Client → Unix Socket → Daemon → Playwright Browser (persistent)

### Head-to-Head Comparison

| Dimension | webctl | site2cli |
|---|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Daemon + CLI client (persistent browser) | Ephemeral browser (launch per discovery) |
| **Primary goal** | Browser automation | Eliminate browser automation |
| **Cookie banners** | Auto-dismiss (vendor selectors + text match) | Auto-dismiss (3-strategy: vendor CSS + text + a11y) |
| **Auth detection** | Login page detection | Login/SSO/OAuth/MFA/CAPTCHA detection |
| **Wait conditions** | network-idle, selector, stable | network-idle, load, selector (exists/visible/hidden), url-contains, text-contains, stable |
| **Page representation** | A11y tree + markdown | A11y tree with CSS fallback |
| **Retry logic** | Action-level retries | Action-level retries with configurable delay |
| **Output formats** | JSON, a11y tree, markdown, screenshot | OpenAPI spec, Python client, MCP server, CLI |
| **Multi-tab** | Yes | No (not needed — browser is temporary) |
| **Agent config** | Claude/generic config generation | Claude MCP config + generic agent prompt |
| **Progressive?** | No (always browser) | Yes (Browser → Workflow → API) |
| **After discovery** | Still needs browser | No browser needed (direct API) |

### Key Takeaway

**Complementary, not competing.** webctl optimizes browser automation; site2cli eliminates it. We adopted webctl's best ideas (cookie banners, auth detection, a11y tree, retries, rich waits, agent init) to make our Tier 1 browser exploration more reliable, while our core value proposition remains: discover the API so you never need the browser again.

### What We Adopted From webctl

1. **Cookie banner auto-dismissal**: 3-strategy approach (vendor CSS, multilingual text, a11y role matching) — makes discovery more reliable on GDPR-compliant sites
2. **Auth page detection**: Detects login/SSO/MFA/CAPTCHA pages and suggests `site2cli auth login` — prevents wasted discovery attempts
3. **Accessibility tree extraction**: Better page representation for LLM context than CSS queries — captures ARIA roles and states
4. **Action retry logic**: Configurable retry with delay — handles transient click/fill failures
5. **Rich wait conditions**: 9 condition types replace the bare `wait_for_timeout(2000)` — more reliable page state detection
6. **Agent init command**: Generate Claude MCP config and generic agent prompts from discovered sites
